# WordCloud-Generator

The script uses the module wordcloud, as well as data structures such as sets and dictionaries
to sort through the text efficeintly after stripping the text of its punctuation and discarding uninteresting words
(ie "a", "the", "you", etc).

This script allows the user to create a random word cloud of any length .txt file they like.  
The word cloud will generate based on the frequency of words in the text, 
so that higher frequency words will have more emphasis in the jpg.
